## Are the Ironhack communication channels effective?

# Problem

Covid has changed our lives. The measures to flatten the curve of infecteds changed forever our behavior. Or not? Do the people follow the rules? Are we responsible enough? Or we can be more responsible if someone is looking after our behaviour? 
To analyze it, I decided to do a social study, using as sample the behaviour of the Lisbon October Ironhack bootcamp students. I took two study variables: The placement of the facemask while eating and the conduct with their facemask once they ate.

# Methodology

The data was collected via observation and it was an experiment done in three steps. The first day was just a control day: to know the normal way of behaving of the students. For the next step it was sent by the Ironhack itself, to every student, a notification via Slack, where it was remembered to follow COVID measures. For the third step, I did a more strong signaling and put a visual notification in different spots of the common area where the students eat. 

The statistical methodology behind was the T-student, which is used to see if a mean of two different samples, in this case of the same population, significantly differ. In this case the significance threshold chosen was 5%. 

# Results

It was seen there was not significant behaviour change in the students. No influence of a naive Slack message, neither effect with more strong and visual notification. However, luckily and happily they were not COVID cases in our bootcamp batch.
